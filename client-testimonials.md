"They helped me with two situations. I owned a property before I bought this one that I'm in now. They were able to help me get off the first loan and the other person situated in an awesome 30-year loan with taking the PMI off and everything so they did an excellent job on that. On top of that, they were able to get me into another home loan and buy another house within three months of each other. It was excellent. It went smoothly, there were no hiccups or anything. I think the whole situation was above and beyond for me. They always kept me updated with what was going on. I never really had to call and say "What do I do next?". They were always a step ahead of the whole game. The work would be done before I even got there. All I had to do was sign papers. There were a few things that I had to get like my own personal information to them but anything other than that it was just smooth sailing for the whole transaction."
