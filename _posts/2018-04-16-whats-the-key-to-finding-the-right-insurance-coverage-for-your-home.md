If you’re a first-time homebuyer shopping for insurance, what can you do to find the coverage that’s right for you?

First, if you don’t understand the types of coverage that come with a homeowners policy, **talk to a licensed professional who you trust.** You buy insurance for the things that ruin your life—not the things that ruin your day. Buying a home is likely the largest and most important purchase you’ll make in your lifetime, and it’s where your family will live, so make sure you protect it by talking to someone who can help you protect it.

This advice applies to the mortgage world as well. You can do your own research online, but by talking to an actual mortgage planner, you can have someone talk you through the entire process and avoid any unwanted surprises.
