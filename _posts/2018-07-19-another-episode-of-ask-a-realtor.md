Are you preparing to list your home but not sure what all you need to do before you do?

Today we are continuing our “Ask a Realtor”series with Desiree Pointer and Nichole Moody of Realty One. They are rock stars in our industry, and definitely know how to serve their clients. This is why I have them here now to answer questions for you.

One common question we receive is “What do I need to know before I list?” Since there is not a lot of inventory, **sellers are hesitant about putting their home on the market.** However, there are ways that you can secure a buyer while still looking for your new home.

Desiree tells me that **people have successfully put their home on the market and secured a buyer by adding a contingency to find a replacement property.** This gives you time to find the property you want without the stress. If for some reason you do not find the home you are looking for, you are able to cancel the transaction and stay in your house.

In a seller's market, the ball is in the seller's court because typically you have a list of other potential buyers. This means that if one buyer does not agree to your terms, you have backup buyers that will definitely say yes.

Nicole tells us that **you can add value to your home before you put it on the market by making it look its best.** They start with a general cleanup. She tells us that since you are moving anyway, you should start by packing all of the things that are not used on a daily basis.

After that, clean your house. There are things that you may not notice as a seller that buyers do notice. Everything in the home needs to be cleaned including your blinds, windows, baseboards, etc. You should also change your air filter.

With regards to remodeling, you may want to repaint if your paint is very specific to you. A fresh coat of paint is inexpensive and it makes it look fresh and clean to potential buyers. You do not necessarily have to put a ton of money into your home to get value added.
