What is an initial consultation? What do Realtors like us cover during it?

The purpose of an initial consultation is to get to know our clients a little more and give them a chance to learn a little more about us.

During this consultation, **we try to figure out what your goals are, help you identify what your budget is, and then do a total cost analysis.** In this analysis, we provide you with both a five-year and 10-year projection to ensure the program we’re putting you on fits your goals.

After that, we’ll talk about all the fees associated with the transaction, who pays them, and why they pay them. We’ll also discuss conferring with an insurance agent so that you have adequate coverage on the property you want to buy. Many times, people assume that the lowest premium represents their best option, and sometimes, that’s not the case.

Other items discussed during this consultation include prepaid interest, the myth of the free mortgage, property taxes, and supplemental taxes.

**By the time we’re done with the consultation, you’ll have a better sense of the entire process from start to finish.** With the proper education, you’ll be able to make the right decision for you and your family.

If you have any questions about this topic or are looking to buy, sell, or get financing, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’d love to help!
