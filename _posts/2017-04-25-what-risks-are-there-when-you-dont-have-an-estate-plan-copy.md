We oftentimes run into clients who don’t have an estate plan in place and aren’t aware of the risks of not having a living trust. We’ve brought in Adam Shiells, with Shiells and Hammer, to help explain.

**If you don’t have an estate plan in place, you open up yourself and your family up to a lot of risk if something bad happens to you.** If you don’t end up making one and something happens, California has a plan for you. However, it’s like picking a suit off a shelf. The suit is cut, sewn, and tailored to fit a lot of people just OK, but it doesn’t fit anybody great.

If you can get to an attorney and make an estate plan, there are a lot of things they can do to custom-tailor that suit and help it fit you much better. Maybe you want to leave money to a charity or you have a family member with extensive medical bills.

Estate planning isn’t just about what happens if you die. It also covers you in the event of an emergency and gives you the power to decide who will make decisions for you. If you’re proactive about planning things up front, the process is much smoother and easier for your loved ones in the event of a tragedy.

**The bottom line is that if you don’t have a living trust or estate plan set up already, you need to do so soon.** If you need to talk to Adam about getting one set up, give him a call at (916) 917-5914.

If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
