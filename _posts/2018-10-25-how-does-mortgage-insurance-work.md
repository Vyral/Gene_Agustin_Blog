<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today Jen Sopinski from National MI is here to help us answer some questions about mortgage insurance.</em></p>

Today begins the launch of a whole new series all about mortgage insurance (MI). To help us kick off the series and answer some important questions, we brought in mortgage insurance queen Jen Sopinski from [National MI.](https://www.nationalmi.com/){: target="_blank"}

**What is mortgage insurance?**

There’s a common misconception that people have that you still need 20% down to purchase a home—that’s simply not correct. Mortgage insurance allows anyone putting less than 20% down to still be able to buy property.

**What does MI cover, and who does it protect?**

Mortgage insurance covers the mortgage as well as whoever is servicing that loan (i.e., the lender). If the consumer goes through default, the lender is protected throughout that process.
