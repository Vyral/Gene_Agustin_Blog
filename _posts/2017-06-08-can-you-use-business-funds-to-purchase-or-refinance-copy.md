There’s a misconception out there that you’re not allowed to use business funds for funds to close in reserves if you’re purchasing or refinancing. There’s also a misconception among people who believe since it’s their funds and it’s a schedule C and they have full access to those funds, they should be able to use them freely.

**From an underwriting standpoint, you are allowed to use business funds for closing.** However, the one piece of documentation you’ll need in order to use business assets for personal use on a purchase or refinance is a letter from your CPA. Your mortgage lender should be able to help you draft that letter or speak with your CPA. This letter just needs to say that your use of those business funds won’t adversely affect the ongoing viability of your business.

This is because if the bulk of your income is generated from your self-employment and you deplete those assets, they want to make sure that depletion won’t render your business inoperable, and thus allow you to keep earning income to pay your mortgage going forward.
