Today, we wanted to do something a little different by giving you a year-end review for 2017.

Bernie did have a recurrence of her thyroid cancer last year, so she was out all of December and a little bit at the beginning of the year. The good news is that the surgery was a huge success. Another huge thing for her was that she registered my daughter for kindergarten a lot sooner than expected.

Gene took a trip to New York with his wife. He kicked and screamed before heading out there because he said he wanted nothing to do with the place. After the trip, he realized that he actually loved New York and would definitely go back. He also made a trip to Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

2017 was a blast! We made it to the top 10 at the President’s club; I was shocked we made it that far, but we couldn’t have done it without all of you. **Thank you for supporting us! It is an honor to serve you.**

Best of luck to you all in 2018!
