Many buyers tend to think that the down payment is the only expense involved in closing. However, this is not the case. **There are actually a few different costs you should be prepared for before you reach the closing table.**

This includes both recurring and nonrecurring closing costs.

Nonrecurring closing costs are one-time fees. These generally include lender fees, appraisal fees, as well as title and escrow charges.&nbsp;

Recurring charges are paid on a continual basis. This includes homeowners insurance, property taxes, and mortgage interest. **You want to make sure that you meet with a quality mortgage advisor who will be able to walk you through what to expect.**&nbsp;

The key is to remember that your funds to close will be more than just a down payment. You need to budget for nonrecurring and recurring closing costs.
