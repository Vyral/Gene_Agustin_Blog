Today, I have Mike Reilly from Farmers Insurance with me to touch on a common question that comes up often in the mortgage business: “Why is the amount of coverage on my homeowner’s policy different from the purchase price or the value of the home?”

California is a unique marketplace. The difference in the numbers comes from something that’s pretty simple. The home’s value and the materials needed to build it are two different stories, and **location is also a driving factor.** If I had a four-bedroom home in San Francisco, it might be worth $2 million, but if I moved to that same home somewhere in the Central Valley, it might be worth $500,000.

The difference is only in where the home is located; it takes the same amount of lumber, the same number of roof tiles, and so on. The reconstruction cost is oftentimes different than the market value because **we don’t insure the dirt that the home sits on.**

If anyone has any questions specific to their situation, feel free to reach out to Mike at Farmers Insurance.
